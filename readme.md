# Navanc Backend

Welcome to the Navanc Backend project! This project is a Node.js Express application integrated with Prisma for ORM, PostgreSQL as the database, and deployed on Render. It follows an MVP architecture pattern.

## Setup

Follow these instructions to set up the Navanc Backend project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Node.js and npm (or yarn)
- PostgreSQL
- Prisma CLI (Install globally via npm or yarn: `npm install prisma -g` or `yarn global add prisma`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/03/navanc-backend.git
```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd navanc-backend
```

3. Install dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

or using yarn:

```bash
yarn
```

### Database Setup

1. Create a PostgreSQL database for the project.

2. Copy the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`.

3. Update the `.env` file with your PostgreSQL database connection string.

4. Apply migrations to the database using Prisma:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev
```

or if you have the Prisma CLI installed globally:

```bash
prisma migrate dev
```

### Running the Server

1. Start the server:

```bash
npm start
```

or using yarn:

```bash
yarn start
```

By default, the server will run on port 3000. You can customize this by modifying the `PORT` variable in the `.env` file.

### Testing

You can use tools like Postman or curl to test the API endpoints once the server is running.

### Deployment

The Navanc Backend application is deployed and accessible at [this link](https://navanc-backend.onrender.com/).

## Technologies Used

- **Express**: Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- **Prisma ORM**: Modern database access toolkit for TypeScript and Node.js.
- **PostgreSQL**: Powerful, open-source relational database system.
- **Render**: Cloud platform for building and hosting web applications and APIs.
- **Body-parser**: Node.js body parsing middleware.
- **Prisma Client**: Auto-generated, type-safe database client for TypeScript and Node.js.
- **MVP Architecture**: Model-View-Presenter architecture pattern for organizing code in a maintainable way.

## App Structure

The Navanc Backend application follows a structured organization for easy maintenance and scalability:

- **Controllers**: Contains the logic for handling HTTP requests and responses.
- **Routes**: Defines the API endpoints and routes for the application.
- **Prisma Middlewares**: Middleware functions for integrating Prisma with the Express application.
- **JWT Authentication**: Implements JWT (JSON Web Tokens) authentication for user authorization.
